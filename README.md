Final lab 3 assignment with all excersises: Created an abstract shape, much like a firework, using lines. Using mouseIsPressed and mouseX if 
and else if statements the color of the firework changes when my mouse is pressed and when my mouse is moved across the canvas. The shape was 
created using a function called drawAbstractShape. For the final assignment I created an ifColor variable that allows me to change the color of 
my shape more easily.
